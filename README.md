# ENAS 344 Final Project
 My final submission for ENAS 344/MUSI 415: Musical Acoustics and Instrument Design.

# Files Included

* figs
    > Contains figures used in the paper.
* stls
    > Contains `.stl` files used for the 3D-printed parts and 3D mock-ups of the base. Note that for the Base and Pipe Holders in the actual instrument, hole measurements were shrunk by ~0.1% in order to make the parts press-fit and due to a slight difference between the actual and expected diameters of the polycarbonate pipe and thicknesses of the white plastic blocks. 
* src
    > Contains the source code uploaded to the Teensy 4.1 used to control the instrument.
* paper.pdf
    > The write-up.
* proj.fzz
    > A Fritzing sketch of the breadboard used in the project.
